Hello All 
In this Repo, I will try to explain algorithms from the MIT 6.006 Lecture Series on Algorithms.
This will be a day to day revision of understanding algorithms with examples every person can understand.
I will try to make the content as relatable as possible.
Any improvements will always be appreciated.
