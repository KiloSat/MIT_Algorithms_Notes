To help motivate myself and you guys to complete this lecture series, I think it is important to understand why humans do things.

Most of us, use the skills we learn to get a job and achieve somewhat relevance in society. 
But after these needs are met, we might feel like there is no purpose left to do things anymore. 
The classic ask yourself "if you had a million dollars,what would you do?" works in all cases and scenarios.  
You might feel like "I'm gonna have a different career anyway" if you have a talent in other fields of life like sports or music. 
But the truth is technology is not limited to just computer science and related fields. 
Technology in the 20th century meant groundbreaking inventions in every aspect of your life. 
Though this might not seem true anymore due to lack of progress in other fields other than computers, it is. 


This could be just a course in Algorithms or it might be a way for us to learn how to learn things (How to think effectively!).
This ability to think, will help you in finding meaningful ways of going through life and most importantly, create value for the people around you in any field of your
choice. 
Keep on grinding (the point where you will fail is the point where incremental progress is being made) through this and be honest with yourself as whether you 
understood every concept implemented in this course.


The following is my understanding as to what is to be taken into account while going through the course.
(1) Trying to understand why we need these algorithms.
(2) Why are some algorithms better than others in certain situations.
(3) Understand the structures and designing knowledge that went into creating these algorithms.
(3) Try to understand where we can apply them in daily life (This one is really something to think about)
(4) Most importantly, derive joy while doing so.

The whole world is rooting for us to do this guys, lets get it done.
